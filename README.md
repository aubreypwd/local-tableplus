# Open TablePlus for Local

Note this is for Local by Flywheel "Lightning" 5.x+

## Installation

Until this ends up in the community list, you can clone this repo into `~/Library/Application Support/Local/addons/` using:

```bash
$ git clone --branch 1.0.0 git@github.com:aubreypwd/local-tableplus.git "~/Library/Application Support/Local/addons/"
```
